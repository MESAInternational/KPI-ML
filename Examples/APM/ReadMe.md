#MESA APM 2.0 KPI-ML Examples

This folder contains example KPI-ML files for APM (Asset Performance Management) 2.0. These files are companion materials to the forthcoming white paper series by MESA on APM 2.0. These KPIs are defined in the first white paper of the series, which is titled "Guidelines for Goal Setting & Implementation Planning". The white paper will be available in the MESA Resource library (https://services.mesa.org/ResourceLibrary) in 2016Q3.
